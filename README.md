CardGame
========

Ruby utility library for various card games.

Really just me playing around with design ideas.

Synopsis
--------

You can compare poker hands.

```ruby
require 'card_game/poker'

include CardGame

Poker.classify(Hand.build("10H JH QH KH AH")) >
Poker.classify(Hand.build("AH AD AS AC KH"))
# => true
```

You can calculate winning cards in Five hundred tricks.

```ruby
require 'card_game/five_hundred'

FiveHundred.winning_card(Trick.new(
  cards: Hand.build("10S JD AH 10D"),
  trump: Suit.hearts,
))
# => Card.from_string("JD")

FiveHundred.winning_card(Trick.new(
  cards: Card.array_from_string("10S JD AH 10D"),
  trump: Suit.clubs,
))
# => Card.from_string("10S")
```

There are also silly monkeypatches you probably don't want to use in real life, but make for fun READMEs.

```ruby
require 'card_game/core_ext'

FiveHundred.winning_card(Trick.new(
  cards: [ "A".♡, 5.♢, 10.♧, "A".♢ ],
  trump: Suit.♢,
))
# => Card.from_string("AD")
```
